Last update: __2025_03_06__

Author: An Artiq user who had never used asyncio or sipyco or artiq before and who wanted to get down the basics.

### How to run?

Enter a subdirectory and follow the instructions.

### What is the goal?

To understand the basic function and usage of some sipyco features.

### How to learn?

- Learn how [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) works from the instructions inside `./asyncio`.
- Learn how [sipyco](https://github.com/m-labs/sipyco/) works from the examples here.
- See how artiq uses sipyco in [artiq/frontend/artiq_master.py](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/frontend/artiq_master.py) (specifically) as well as in [artiq/master/](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/tree/master/artiq/master) and [artiq/frontend/](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/tree/master/artiq/frontend) (generally).
